# CSCI_4366_project
Audio Classification

Summary: The goal of this project is audio classifation through human speech, classifying it into the emotion being heard. The current working is idea is this: mp3-> wav file -> spectogram -> classification. I decided on this as spectograms are essentially images of audio waves and we already have work with image classification. Is this cheating... probably. But I figured this would be easier for one person it would also mean I can preprocess all audio files before training the ML making it easier to work with when I want to fine tune it.  Currently I am able to convert from mp3 -> wav -> spectogram and I just need to apply this all audio files.

# Notice
There are many abosolute paths in both files. If you want to them (which I dont reccomend) youll need to change those sorry
The folder with the images was too large to upload even zipped, so if you really want to see them then you can convert them, but it takes forever
